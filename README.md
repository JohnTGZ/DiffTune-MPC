# DiffTune-MPC
This repository contains the matlab code to implement DiffTune-MPC on a unicycle model with the system dyanmics and constraints included in 'Unicycle_model.m'. The file 'unicycle_difftune.m' includes the code to auto-tune the MPC parameters for a tracking problem on the unicycle model using the method proposed in the paper 'DiffTune-MPC: Closed-Loop Learning for Model Predictive Control'. To apply DiffTune-MPC, please implement acados following [https://docs.acados.org/matlab_octave_interface/index.html.](https://docs.acados.org/index.html)
