# DiffTune-MPC
This repository contains the matlab code to implement DiffTune-MPC on a differential wheeled robot with system dyanmics and constraints included in 'Differential_Wheeled_Robot.m'. The file 'Differential_Wheeled_Robot_Difftune.m' includes the code to auto-tune the MPC parameters for a tracking problem on this model using the method proposed in the paper 'DiffTune-MPC: Closed-Loop Learning for Model Predictive Control'. Specifically, we solve the original MPC problem using acados and the auxiliary MPC problem (for analytical gradient) using quadprog. To apply DiffTune-MPC, please first install acados following [https://docs.acados.org/matlab_octave_interface/index.html.](https://docs.acados.org/index.html) and read the problem formulation in acados.
